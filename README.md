# Citi-Bike
Repository for analysing NYC's Citi Bike system data.

The project is based on the monthly Citi Bike datasets in 2019.

Please note that some of the .py scripts require the Citi Bike datasets to be available in the directory. These can be found on Citi Bike's [system data webpage](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
