# Citi-Bike
Repository for analysing NYC's Citi Bike system data.

The project is based on the monthly Citi Bike datasets in 2019.

The 2019 sample which is used in the 2019 analysis file could not be uploaded because of GitHubs limit of 25MB. The [2019 sample](https://we.tl/t-p6H4Zva7xV) can be downloaded via WeTransfer.

Please note that some of the .py scripts require the Citi Bike datasets to be available in the directory. These can be found on Citi Bike's [system data webpage](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
