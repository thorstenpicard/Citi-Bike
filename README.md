# Citi-Bike
Repository for analysing NYC's Citi Bike system data.

The project is based on the monthly Citi Bike datasets in 2019.

The 2019 sample which is used in the 2019 analysis file could not be uploaded because of GitHubs limit of 25MB. The sample can be downloaded via WeTransfer [here](https://we.tl/t-p6H4Zva7xV).
